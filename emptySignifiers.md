## People ...

# To get everybody on the same page

Abtract away the detail and get everybody to agree on the principle.

We can all come together under the banner of Agile, right?

We all mean the same thing when we say TDD, right?

# But then comes the detail

... and the nuance

... and other ideas

... and dilution of the core concept
 
... and certifications

## And detail needed by practitioners is lost or blurred

# Ask for clarity

It doesn't mean you don't understand.

It just means you want to understand it the same way.

"I do not think it means what you think it means"
